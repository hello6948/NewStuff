	<p style="height: 100%;">Well Raj created these sites as a means of having fun and he really had quite the fun. At this time, he didn't even realise that it was 11PM. "This shit is fun." Raj said, "CSS is really helpful thing."<br> The next day he even thought to stay up till 2am of another next day.<br>In the end, Raj's pretty sure he will be able to improve more on this</p><br><br>
